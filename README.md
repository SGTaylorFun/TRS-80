Radio Shack TRS-80 Programs
===========================

This is a catalog of programs that I created for my first computer, a Radio Shack Model 1. I still have it and it still runs, although the cassette player it used for storage seized up some time ago. I am still coding for a living today!

I recently found this excellent emulator:

Thank you George Phillips for bringing back the joy of those early days.

I have a few printouts of the source code for the games I created between 1978 and 1981. I have never shared them with anyone except a few of my friends. I hope there are a few veterans out there that can appreciate what could be done 45 years ago with 16KB of RAM, a million times less than the computer I am typing this into!

To run these programs, first install the trs80gp emulator. You only need the stand-alone trs80gp.exe file. Run the go.bat file to start the emulator with the parameters set to the Model 1 specifications.

Sector Zulu
-----------
This was inspired by Trek-80, the text-based Star Trek game written on the Sol-20 computer:

To run it locally, run the go.bat file to start the emulator.
For MEM SIZE? enter 26499. This reserves just enough RAM for the game storage.
From the File menu, select Run and open the Zulu.cas file.

Forest Fire
-----------
A real time game that simulates a forest fire and scores your efforts to contain it.

To run it locally, run the go.bat file to start the emulator.
From the File menu, select Run and open the ForestFire.cas file.
