Radio Shack TRS-80 Programs
===========================

This is a catalog of programs that I created for my first computer, a Radio Shack Model 1. I still have it and it still runs, although the cassette player it used for storage seized up some time ago. I am still coding for a living today!

I recently found this excellent emulator:

Thank you George Phillips for bringing back the joy of those early days.

I have a few printouts of the source code for the games I created between 1978 and 1981. I have never shared them with anyone except a few of my friends. I hope there are a few veterans out there that can appreciate what could be done 45 years ago with 16KB of RAM, a million times less than the computer I am typing this into!

This was inspired by Trek-80, the text-based Star Trek game written on the Sol-20 computer:

To run it locally, follow these steps:
1) Install the trs80gp emulator. You only need the stand-alone trs80gp.exe file.
1) Run the go.bat file to start the emulator with the parameters set to the Model 1 specifications.
2) For MEM SIZE? enter 26499. This reserves just enough RAM for the game storage.
3) From the File menu, select Run and open the Zulu.cas file.
4) Enjoy!
