SECTOR ZULU

Mem Size? 26499

You are in command of the space ship EPSILON 1.
The mission: to search out and destroy all enemy ships threatening to overtake this sector of the galaxy.

Entities:
+ - EPSILON 1 - Your ship
@ - KRYLON - Enemy: Easy to dispose of but there are lots of them (16-25)
& - XORIAN - Enemy: These are mean critters - takes more than one torpedo (3-5)
% - SPECTOR - Enemy: Close friends of the above - about average to destroy (6-10)
? - UNKNOWN - They won't bother you if you don't bother them, but if you do hit one expect anything to happen (6-10)
# - BASE - Breathe a sigh of relief - refuel/re-arm here! (4-6)
* - STAR - Blocks your movement and missiles
^ - ASTEROID - Short range sensors don't detect and stop movement - flying into one does 100-300 units damage
  - BLACK HOLE - Like asteroid, except it can't be destroyed and it is a little less noticeable
. - EMPTY SPACE
X - BOUNDARY
Weapons:
  - ALPHA RAY - Fires the specified amount of energy at all enemy ships within view, with closer ships getting more damage
  - ION BEAM - 100 units damage to ship hit - 3 spaces range
! - TORPEDO - They move slowly, 200 units damage given (10)
$ - QUANTUM MINE - Moves randomly until exploded - destroys anything within a one unit radius,
turning it into non-space

Strength of ships:
EPSILON 1 = 1000
KRYLON    = 50-150
XORIAN    = 400-700
SPECTOR   = 100-400

Energy distribution:
FFD - Force Field
      Takes the blows of enemy fire (and asteroids).
      If it reaches 0, all other systems drop quickly and irregularly.
ENG - Engines
      Lowered by movement. Operate above 0 units.
COM - Computer/Support Systems
      Fall slowly and steadily.
      If it drops below 50 units, many functions like the alpha ray are affected.
      If it reaches 0, you've had it!
ION - Ion beam
      Takes 20 units each time used, until it reaches 0 units.
RAY - Alpha ray
      The amount fired is used up, down to 0 units.

Commands:
Level 1                         Level 2          Level 3      
M - Movement                    Direction (1-8)  Speed (1-5)
S - Stop movement
R - Alpha ray                   Units to fire
I - Ion beam                    Direction (1-8)
T - Torpedo                     Direction (1-8)
Q - Launch quantum mine         Direction (1-8)
X - Explode quantum mine
E - Change energy distribution  # of units       From (F/E/C/I/R) To (F/E/C/I/R)
C - Computer information        Number of (K/X/S/Q/T/B)
H - Hyperspace jump
D - Self destruct               A - Abort

Pressing "A" in level 2 and 3 aborts any command

Movement:
Press "M", then the direction (1-8), then the speed. Press "S" to stop.
Short range sensors automatically shut down the engines when you come across a star,
a base, an enemy ship, or the galactic perimeter.
They do not detect asteroids, black holes, torpedos, or quantum mines.

Hyperspace takes you instantly to a random location in the galaxy.
However, if you arrive anywhere but empty space, your ship will be destroyed.
Use this option only for emergencies.
