FOREST FIRE

"Forest Fire" is a simulation game for one player.
The object of the game is to extinguish a growing fire
which is threatening the town and farms of the countryside.
To do this, you can supervise the construction of barriers
which block the path of the fire, or direct a water scooper airplane
to skim water from the lake and drop it over a wider area.

You can only move so quickly, so much of the strategy is in deciding
what to sacrifice in order to save the most amount of land.
The game ends when the fire is completely extinguished.
You will then receive a report on the results of the fire,
and a skill rating based on how well you protected the town ("#"),
farms ("F"), and forest of the area, in that order of importance.

As soon as the game begins you can move, build fire barriers,
or collect or drop water by pressing keys on the keyboard.
Your initial position is marked by a "+" symbol in the town.
The fire will appear as a single "*" symbol in the forest.
Below is a list of all the commands:

Arrow - Moves one space in one of four directions.
    X - Constructs a fire barrier at your location.
        Fire cannot start on or cross a barrier.
        You can build anywhere that is not actively burning,
        including the town and farms, but this destroys
        the value of the land.
    W - If you are over the lake ("L"), collects water.
        Your position marker will change to a "W".
		After filling up, press "W" again to drop water
		anywhere on the map.
        This puts out fire in a nine acre area around you.
        It makes it harder for fire to start in that area,
        or to spread to surrounding land if it does start.
    E - Ends the game and gives you the final report.
